        core_algorithm: Core Relief Algorithm to perform VLSRelief iterations on
        weight_flag: int (default: 1)
            flag to determine whether weight update performed on distance measure alone (weight_flag=1)
            or on both distance and score (weight_flag = 2)
        n_features_to_select: int (default: 10)
            the number of top features (according to the relieff score) to
            retain after feature selection is applied.
        max_iter: int (default 10)
            the maximum number of iterations to be performed.
        discrete_threshold: int (default: 10)
            Value used to determine if a feature is discrete or continuous.
            If the number of unique levels in a feature is > discrete_threshold, then it is
            considered continuous, or discrete otherwise.
        verbose: bool (default: False)
            If True, output timing of distance array and scoring
        n_jobs: int (default: 1)
            The number of cores to dedicate to computing the scores with joblib.
            Assigning this parameter to -1 will dedicate as many cores as are available on your system.
            We recommend setting this parameter to -1 to speed up the algorithm as much as possible.
